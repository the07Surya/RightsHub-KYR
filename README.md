I’m super excited to share with you my new "websitedesign idea!" I’ve been working hard on creating something new after my web development course. It’s a "PROTOTYPE" on legal awareness and consultation using html CSS and basic JavaScript. Description:- Many citizens in India are unaware of their legal rights and often do not know how to seek redressal in case of legal violations here we try to develop a digital assistant that can provide legal information and guidance to people in a user-friendly manner. The digital assistant should be able to provide information in a concise and easy-to-understand manner. This platform helps user to book legal aid from their desired lawyer also. The platform should be accessible through various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The digital assistant should also be able to provide information on various legal topics, such as family law, property law, labor law, and criminal law.
